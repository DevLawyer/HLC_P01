                <h3>What is Visual Studio Code?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS, and the Web. Includes support for debugging, built-in Git control, syntax highlighting, 
                smart code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is also customizable, so users can change the editor theme, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. It is free and open source, 
                although the official download is under proprietary software and includes features customized by Microsoft.

                IntelliSense is a code-completion aid that includes a number of features: List Members, Parameter Info, Quick Info, and Complete Word. These features help you to learn more about the code 
                you're using, keep track of the parameters you're typing, and add calls to properties and methods with only a few keystrokes.
                Visual Studio Code has this functionality, providing a confortable and fast way of programming.

                <h3>Built-in Git</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. 
                Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
                Using a Built-in Git makes having an external git program useless in terms of efficiency.

            </header>
            <p>
                Installing extensions to your VSC (Visual Studio Code) delivers infinite posibilities like formatting addons, new languages, themes made by the community, etc. Your extensions will run 
                in separate processes, so they won't slow down your editor.
